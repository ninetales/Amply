# Amply

## Description
Amply is a decentralized energy marketplace designed to empower households and small communities to trade renewable energy directly with one another. Using blockchain technology, Amply facilitates peer-to-peer energy transactions, enabling users to connect to local grids, manage their energy supply, and use a flat rate price for trading kilowatt-hours (kWh). This innovative platform promotes energy independence, sustainable practices, and greater adoption of renewable energy sources. Amply aims to demonstrate the potential of localized, decentralized energy trading through a streamlined proof-of-concept.
